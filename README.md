**Travel Guide AI**
=====================

Overview
--------

The Travel Guide AI is an innovative Python project that leverages artificial intelligence to create personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences. The program utilizes APIs such as Google Maps API and Yelp Fusion API for data sources, enabling users to explore new destinations with ease and confidence.

Business Plan
-------------

The primary goal of the Travel Guide AI project is to provide an intuitive and personalized travel planning experience for users. By combining machine learning algorithms and APIs, this project aims to:

1. Offer customized travel recommendations based on user preferences (e.g., budget, interests, preferred activities).
2. Generate detailed itineraries that include must-visit attractions, popular restaurants, and other points of interest tailored to each user's unique tastes.
3. Continuously improve the AI model by incorporating user feedback and updating data sources as needed.
4. Establish strategic partnerships with travel industry players (e.g., airlines, hotels, tour operators) to expand the project's reach and enhance its offerings.
5. Monetize the platform through various revenue streams such as advertising, premium subscriptions, or affiliate marketing agreements with partner businesses.

Project Structure
-----------------

The Travel Guide AI Python project consists of two main components: a BeautifulSoup library for web scraping and an OpenAI GPT model for understanding user preferences. The code structure is as follows:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import json
class TravelGuide:
    def __init__(self, user_preferences):
        self.user_preferences = user_preferences
        
    def generate_itinerary(self):
        # Use OpenAI GPT to understand the user's preferences and create a personalized itinerary
        pass
```
